# TP-Game-of-Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

How to run it:

```batch
git clone https://github.com/DEVmorticus215/TP-Game-of-Life.git
cd TP-Game-of-Life
setup.bat runJar
```
